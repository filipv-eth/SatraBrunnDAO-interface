# Landing Page

## Design

`@filipv-eth` design lives here on the figma: https://www.figma.com/file/K9dgs45L7Q6XFkKnU8roK7/S%C3%A4tra-Brunn-DAO-Website?node-id=0%3A1. <3

## Getting started

The website is built with Svelte. It's lightweight and doesn't rely on a virtual DOM. If you know some markup and css, you can be helpful. If you know js, you're good to go. If you know nothing but would love to start programming, write a message on the `frontend` in Discord and you'll receive a bitesized task and helpful links to get started. Checkout the files under `src/` to get an understanding of how the website is structured.

### Install

```shell
npm install
```

### Develop

Below command will start a development server that autoreloads on save, and opens a port on your network - which is nice if you have extra devices, you can put them around you and see on the fly how things are turning out.

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Production

When you're happy with your changes, run

```shell
npm run build
```

All you need to do now is push your branch and make a pull-request on Github.
If it is a minor change that doesn't need input, push to `main` branch and the page will be live momentarily - we are after all a decentralized community, so we trust your judgement.

### Tools

We use Prettify to auto-format text.
